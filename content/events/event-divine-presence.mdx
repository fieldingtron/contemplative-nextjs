How do you experience the unfolding mystery of the Incarnation in your life? How do you open up to the Divine Presence residing in you at every moment? How can centering prayer keep you mindful of your relationship with God and help you foster that relationship? Fr. Bill, our much beloved master teacher who has guided many of us on retreats, will explore these questions and help us deepen our spiritual life which touches every other part of life.


The Gospel of Matthew expresses God’s desire for our happiness with Jesus’ call for us to go into our inner room, close the door and pray to our Father in secret Yet, as Fr. Bill reminds us, the greatest obstacle to our spiritual journey is to pray as if we are separated from God. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is this intimacy and tenderness that God offers us, as St. Augustine declared, “You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you.”


The human ego longs for a compassionate gaze. With the practice of silence, we can become gradually loosened from the exaggerated ego demands that distract us from the trust and faith in the Divine Indwelling. We are all one with God—it is our common ground, our interconnectedness with each other and all of creation. God is love, and when we pray, we open ourselves to feel that love. Join us as we gather for a weekend free of distractions to enjoy the gift of silent presence with God who made you and loves you beyond imagination.


Richmond Hill is an ecumenical Christian Community founded in 1987 and located in the historic monastery of the Sisters of the Visitation of Monte Maria on Church Hill in the center of Richmond. The mission of the Community is to pray and work for the transformation of Metropolitan Richmond through prayer, hospitality, racial reconciliation and spiritual development. There is anecdotal evidence that Richmond Hill, the highest hill in Richmond, has been a place of prayer for several millennia. Native Americans have confirmed this use of the hill when the land was still known as Tsenacomoco. The hill overlooks the falls of the James River and faces the setting sun.


Richmond Hill is COVID\-WISE, taking every possible precaution to make the environment safe. Masks are required. Accommodations will be made for social distancing, safe dining and meeting areas.
