Father Bill Sheehan has been deeply committed to Contemplative Outreach since it was founded in 1983 by Fr. Thomas Keating, OCSO. Fr. Bill will share his wisdom and experience in dealing with the evolving new normal of Covid which caught us unaware and continues to take hold in our lives, confining us, keeping us away from our usual way of living, family and friends.


There is one relationship, however, that is always present—it doesn’t come, it doesn’t go, it is always with us. God is the divine indwelling within each of us and all of creation. Every prayer we offer is rooted in relationship with him.
