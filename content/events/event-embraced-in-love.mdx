Fr. Bill Sheehan will present conferences in the morning and afternoon
and lead two centering prayer sits. Our gathering will include time


for Q\&A and comments, as well as two breaks.


The practice of Centering Prayer opens us up to receive the love
pouring out from the Holy One—with no conditions or judgment on
God’s part and no striving or struggling on our part. Centering prayer is
a practice of letting go, allowing ourselves to be embraced
by the divine with total acceptance just as we are.
Fr. Bill has been deeply committed to Contemplative Outreach
since its founding by Fr. Thomas Keating, OCSO 40 years ago.


He has led centering prayer workshops and retreats throughout the United States
and abroad. He has a rich background as a pastor, director of ministry to priests,
novice director, director of formation, provincial, and director of the Oblate House
of Theology. Among teachers of the faith journey and presence of the divine
indwelling, few deserve the title “master teacher” as does Fr. Bill.
