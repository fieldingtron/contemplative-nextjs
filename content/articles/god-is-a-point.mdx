The Point of God – pondering “great things come in small packages”, why the mystics see God as a point of nothingness or miniscule material/spirituality. Is this our path to understanding the “divine indwelling” with our finite minds?

**Thomas Merton**

“At the center of our being is a \*\*point\*\* of nothingness which is untouched by sin and by illusion, a point of pure truth, a point or spark which belongs entirely to God, which is never at our disposal, from which God disposes of our lives, which is inaccessible to the fantasies of our own mind or the brutalities of our own will. This little point of nothingness and of absolute poverty is the pure glory of God in us. It is so to speak His name written in us, as our poverty, as our indigence, as our dependence, as our sonship. It is like a pure diamond, blazing with the invisible light of heaven. It is in everybody, and if we could see it we would see these billions of points of light coming together in the face and blaze of a sun that would make all the darkness and cruelty of life vanish completely. I have no program for this seeing. It is only given. But the gate of heaven is every- where.”

**Julian of Norwich**

The third showing surprised Julian and made her think for many years. She saw in her understanding that Deity is a \*\*point\*\*, "by which I saw that He is in all things". For Julian, as for Isaiah, the Divine does all that is done.

**Creation and the Point**

“The widely accepted age of the universe, as estimated by general relativity, is 13.8 billion years. In the beginning, everything in existence is thought to have occupied a single infinitely dense \*\*point\*\*, or singularity. Only after this point began to expand in a "Big Bang" did the universe officially begin.” “The discoveries of twentieth–century science, especially Big Bang cosmology (“universalism” or cosmic wholeness) and evolution (nature's openness to the future), ushered in two new dimensions of life, wholeness and futurism. Contrary to the ancient Ptolemaic cosmos of order, stasis, and hierarchy, the Big Bang cosmos was now seen in its evolving capacity for greater wholeness and openness to consummation in the future.”

**DNA as a Point  - Ilia Delio**

Many religious believers use the existence of DNA as a proof for God's existence. The logic goes something like this: DNA is information. The amount of information encapsulated in a single strand of human DNA (point) would fill 400 volumes the size of an Encyclopedia Britannica, and this information contains an exact blueprint for creating a human being. This information did not write itself. The creation of information requires intelligence. The creation of an encyclopedia requires an author - a creator. God is the creator of the information in DNA. So, do we all inherit this microscopic DNA from God which makes us heirs of Love?

**The Seed of God – Meister Eckhart**

“The seed of God is in us. Given an intelligent and hard-working farmer, it will thrive and grow up to God, whose seed it is; and accordingly its fruits will be God-nature. Pear seeds grow into pear trees, nut seeds into nut trees, and God-seed into God.”

**The Omega Point**

The Omega Point is a spiritual belief and a scientific speculation that everything in the universe is fated to spiral towards a final \*\*point\*\* of "divine" unification. The term was coined by the French Jesuit Catholic priest Pierre \*\*Teilhard de Chardin\*\* (1881–1955).

**A Circled Dot, the point of God**

The circled dot, an ancient symbol for the metaphysical Absolute. Early science, particularly geometry and astrology and astronomy, was connected to the divine for most medieval scholars, and many believed that there was something intrinsically "divine" or "perfect" that could be found in circles.   Research by Phil Stone, a seeker of God, September 2017
