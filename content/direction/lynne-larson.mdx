Lynne Larson, M.A. completed training in spiritual direction in 2012 through the Spiritual Direction Institute at The Well Retreat Center and has long been interested in the mystics and the application of spiritual practices.


In 2004 she established Retreats to offer seekers a time to set aside the demands of everyday life and come together for rest and spiritual renewal. She offers retreats and workshops on Julian of Norwich, Celtic spirituality and other spiritual programs. She sees in ancient traditions a modern approach to heal the human condition through the constant reminder that Godâ€™s loving presence is in all creation.


As a dream specialist with over 40 years of study and listening to thousands of dreams, she teaches and conducts dream workshops and works with individuals privately. She lives in Cape Charles, Virginia.
